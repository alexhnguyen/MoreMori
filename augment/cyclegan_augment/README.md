## Augment backgrounds for segmented images

This code modifies the original CycleGAN code to also randomly augment the background.

Go the the folder `pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/data`.<br/>
Replace `base_dataset.py` with the one in this folder.<br/>
Move `augment_background.py` into `pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/data` as well.
